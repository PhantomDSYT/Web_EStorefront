            With the belief that the diamond and engagement ring industries were ready for innovation, Noble Jewelry & Diamonds was established in 1999. 
            With a revolutionary online business model, we transformed the sector and made it possible to purchase exceptional, top-notch diamonds at a competitive price. We continued after that too.

            We were also adamant that our clients deserved more options, clear information, and unmatched service. 
            Building a group of devoted, independent diamond and jewelry professionals who prioritize the needs of the consumer was something we took very seriously. 
            (We're delighted to report that some of our clients have even invited our professionals to their weddings!)



            We are the industry pioneer in handcrafted engagement rings and stunning fine jewelry, and we're always coming up with innovative ideas to make it easier for you to find and create the perfect piece.
